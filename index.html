   <h4>Our Wrestling Team</h4>
     <p>Wrestling has been one of the biggest parts of my life since I started in
       6th grade. In high school our team won a division 1 state championship in
       2016 and we were runner up in 2015. I was also a state qulifier and
       starter all 4 years of highschool. At Alma we have about 30 guys on our
       team and an awesome incoming freshman class. Check out our website at Alma!
